# 🧠 ML-Project: Predictive Modeling with Scikit-Learn

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my journey into Machine Learning and Data Science. It demonstrates a complete ML pipeline—from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation—using Python and scikit-learn. The goal is to build a predictive model and understand the workflow behind supervised learning.

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ArianJr/ML-Project.git
cd ML-Project

### Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

### Run the project
python main.py

## Results:
The model achieves an accuracy of XX% on the test set.
Additional metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to evaluate performance.
Visualizations include:
- Confusion Matrix
- Feature Importance
- Learning Curve
